#  LibNFCSwift

This is a wrapper library to call libnfc from Swift since CoreNFC does not support third party NFC readers. I am using this in a personal project so if this project eats your lunch... I am open to pull requests!

Another note, this project is licensed LGPL only because libnfc is LGPL. If I can relicense it to something weaker I will.
